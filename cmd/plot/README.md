# `cmd/plot`

`cmd/plot` is a command line tool, which parses the log file (e.g.,
`nohup.out`) generated by `cmd/singlethread` or `cmd/multithread` and
looks for log messages about perplexity versus training iteration,
which will then be plotted.

In practices, we often start training job using `nohup`, which will
concatenate log messages to an existing `nohup.out` file. Therefore, a
`nohup.out` file might record more than one training processes.
`cmd/plot` plots only the last (most recent) process, and ignores
previous ones.

`cmd/plot` uses `code.google.com/p/plotinum` for plotting and thus can
support multiple output formats, which was specfied by the extension
filename of the output.

The following invocation generates a png file:

     $GOPATH/bin/plot -log=/tmp/nohup.out -plot=/tmp/nohup.png

The following generates a pdf file:

     $GOPATH/bin/plot -log=/tmp/nohup.out -plot=/tmp/nohup.pdf

### For Developers

1. If you change the log message format of training programs, for
   example, `cmd/singlethread` or `cmd/multithread`, make sure they
   have the same format.

1. If the log format is changed, make sure you change `cmd/plot`
   accordingly.
